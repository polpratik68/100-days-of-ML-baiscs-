The "car data.csv" file is a dataset that contains valuable information about various cars, including attributes such as Car_Name, Year, Selling_Price, Present_Price, Kms_Driven, Fuel_Type, Seller_Type, Transmission, and Owner.

This dataset offers a wealth of information for analyzing and understanding the factors that influence the selling price of cars. By exploring this dataset, we can gain insights into how factors like the car's age, mileage, fuel type, seller type, transmission, and ownership history impact its market value.

The dataset can be utilized for various data analysis and machine learning tasks. It provides an opportunity to preprocess and clean the data, perform exploratory data analysis, and build predictive models to estimate the selling price of cars accurately. This project aims to leverage the dataset's features and apply machine learning techniques to create a robust model capable of predicting car selling prices with reasonable accuracy.

By uploading this file and working with its data, we can delve into the world of car pricing, uncover hidden patterns, and develop practical applications that assist car sellers and buyers in making informed decisions.
